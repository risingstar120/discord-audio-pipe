Simple program to send stereo audio (microphone, stereo mix, virtual audio cable, etc) into a discord bot.

You can download the latest release [**here**](https://github.com/QiCuiHub/discord-audio-pipe/releases)
- If you are using the source code, install the dependencies and start the program using `main.pyw`
- The `.exe` does not require python or dependencies

## Setting up a Bot account
1. Follow the steps [**here**](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html) to setup and invite a discord bot
2. To link the program to your bot, create a file ``token.txt`` in the same directory as the `.exe` / `main.pyw` and save the bot token inside

## Dependencies
Requires Python 3.5+. Install dependencies by running `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

In some cases PortAudio and xcb libraries may be missing on linux. On Ubuntu they can be installed with
```
    $ sudo apt-get install libportaudio2
    $ sudo apt-get install libxcb-xinerama0
```

## CLI
Running the `.exe` / `main.pyw` without any arguments will start the graphical interface. Alternatively, discord-audio-pipe can be run from the command line and contains some tools to query system audio devices and accessible channels.
```
usage: main.pyw [-h] [-t TOKEN] [-v] [-c CHANNEL] [-d DEVICE] [-D] [-C]
